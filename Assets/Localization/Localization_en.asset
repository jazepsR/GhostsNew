    m_Localized: Jaunpils Castle is an ancient Livonian Order castle, built in 1301.
      The castle has been burned down and rebuilt many times. Over the centuries,
      numerous castle legends and tales have accumulated. One of the most famous
      ones is that of baron Matiass fon der Reke, who ruled in the age of chivalry.
      When the baron died, old folks used to tell stories that his spirit wandered
      through the castle, as during his lifetime, he was fierce and ruthless, so
      his soul knows no rest.
